Corpus of a Siam Mosquito - Steven Sills "So he spoke, and the bright-eyed goddess, Athene, was pleased that she was the god he prayed to before all the others. She put strength in his shoulders and knees, and set in his heart the daring of a mosquito, which, though constantly brushed away from a man's skin, still insists on biting him for the pleasure of human blood." - The Iliad Â Â Homer
