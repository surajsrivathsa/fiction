Scene: Through the curtained doorway of Mrs. Edward Roberts's pretty drawing-room, in Hotel Bellingham, shows the snowy and gleaming array of a table set for dinner, under the dim light of gas-burners turned low.Â An air of expectancy pervades the place, and the uneasiness of Mr. Roberts, in evening dress, expresses something more as he turns from a glance into the dining-room, and still holding the portiÃ¨re with one hand, takes out his watch with the other. Mr. Roberts to Mrs. Roberts entering the drawing-room from regions beyond: "My dear, it's six o'clock.Â What can have become of your aunt?" Mrs. Roberts, with a little anxiety: "That was just what I was going to ask.Â She's never late; and the children are quite heart-broken.Â They had counted upon seeing her, and talking Christmas a little before they were put to bed."
