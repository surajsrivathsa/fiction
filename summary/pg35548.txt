Sir Philip Sidney 'There! I do not think that the joys and sorrows of living in a little house under the shadow of a big one were ever more lucidly set forth,' says an elder sister, holding up the slate on which she has just been totting up this ingenious debit and credit account to a pink junior, kneeling, head on hand, beside her; a junior who, not so long ago, did sums on that very slate, and the straggle of briony round whose sailor-hat tells that she has only just left the sunburnt harvest-fields and the overgrown August hedgerows behind her. 'We have had a good deal of fun out of it too,' says she, rather remorsefully. 'Do you remember' - with a sigh of recollected enjoyment - 'the day that we all blackened our faces with soot, and could not get the soot off again afterwards?'
