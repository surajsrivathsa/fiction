"What is the book?" "According to the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese characters of the title, we call it Mu-Mon-Kwan, which means 'The Gateless Barrier.' It is one of the books especially studied by the Zen sect, or the sect of DhyÃ¢na. A peculiarity of some of the DhyÃ¢na texts - this story being a good example - is that they are not explanatory. They only suggest. Questions are put, but the student must think out the answers for himself. He must think them out but not write them. You know that DhyÃ¢na represents human effort to reach, through meditation, zones of thought beyond the range of verbal expression; and any thought narrowed into utterance loses all DhyÃ¢na quality.... Well, this story is supposed to be true; but it is used only for a DhyÃ¢na question...." "Exotics and Retrospectives," pages 83, 84.
