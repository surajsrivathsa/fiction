And Sent out a Jet of Fire from His Nostrils "And Sent out a Jet of Fire from His Nostrils"Ã‚ Drawing by Power O'Malley. To illustrate "In the House of Suddhoo," by Rudyard Kipling Title page Somewhere in the Other World, where there are books and pictures and plays and shop windows to look at, and thousands of men who spend their lives in building up all four, lives a gentleman who writes real stories about the real insides of people; and his name is Mr. Walter Besant. But he will insist upon treating his ghosts - he has published half a workshopful of them - with levity. He makes his ghost-seers talk familiarly, and, in some cases, flirt outrageously, with the phantoms. You may treat anything, from a Viceroy to a Vernacular Paper, with levity; but you must behave reverently toward a ghost, and particularly an Indian one.
