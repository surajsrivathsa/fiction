Quite naturally it will be discussed; some, doubtless, will censure it - and unjustly; others will believe with me that the tale teaches a great moral lesson. Born as the Boy was born, the end which Fate forced upon him, to me, was inevitable. Each word and act of the three weeks of his parents' love-idyl must reflect in the character and life of the child. Little by little the baby King grew before my mental vision until I saw at last there was no escape from his importunity and I allowed the insistent Boy - masterful even from his inception - to shape himself at his own sweet will. Thus he became the hero of my study.
