IN this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: Â the Missouri negro dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect; the ordinary "Pike County" dialect; and four modified varieties of this last. The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech. I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding. Scene: Â The Mississippi Valley Time: Â Forty to fifty years ago WE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. Â She had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty men, likely. Â She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. Â There was a power of style about her. Â It AMOUNTED to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that.
