My dear Erlanger, - Through the many anxieties which beset me while I was writing this story, your name was continually recurring, and always with some act of kindness, or some proof of affection. Let me, then, in simple gratitude dedicate to you a volume of which, in a measure, you stand sponsor, and say to the world at large what I have so often said to my own, How sincerely and heartily I am Your friend, CHARLES LEVER. Trieste, February 20th, 1869.
