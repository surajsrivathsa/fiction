"Now, doctor, you know my secret, and the whole of it," said Zabra, at the conclusion of a long and interesting narrative he had communicated to Dr. Tourniquet, upon one of his professional visits. "Let not a word pass from your lips concerning what I have told you, for it would do me irreparable mischief. Be in your behaviour to me exactly as you have been. The slightest alteration would create suspicion, and that I am most anxious to avoid. May I rely upon you?" "Rely upon me!" cried the surgeon, while his good-natured countenance was glowing with benevolence. "If you ever catch me saying a word, I'll allow any body to make a preparation of me before I'm dead. I'd sooner demonstrate upon my own skeleton, don't you see, than betray your secret. By all that's good, you're an extraordinary creature - a more extraordinary creature than ever I met with in the whole course of my practice. I always thought there was something strange about you, don't you see - a mystery I could not exactly understand - but now every thing appears as simple as the first rudiments of medicine." "You gratify me exceedingly by this assurance," observed the youth, "and I am delighted by your ready acquiescence with my wishes. How can I best express my gratitude?"
