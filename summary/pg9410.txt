XXV. McIVER's OPPORTUNITY "Take up our quarrel with the foe: To you from failing hands we throw Â Â The torch; be yours to hold it high. Â Â If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow Â Â Â Â In Flanders fields." No well informed resident of Millsburgh, when referring to the principal industry of his little manufacturing city, ever says "the mills" - it is always "the Mill."
