TO EVELINA HEMINWAY SMITH "Sister - Friend" Accept the dedication of this book of mine as a very slight recognition of your encouragement in my work; your faith in me. To you I first read the story; from you I received my first approval; I believe its chances will be brighter in the book-world if your name and good-will go with it.
