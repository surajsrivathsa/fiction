IN this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: Â the Missouri negro dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect; the ordinary "Pike County" dialect; and four modified varieties of this last. The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech. I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding. Scene: Â The Mississippi Valley Time: Â Forty to fifty years ago YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter. Â That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. Â There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. Â That is nothing. Â I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Â Aunt Polly - Tom's Aunt Polly, she is - and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.
