A dark November afternoon - wet, and windy, and wild. The New York streets were at their worst - sloppy, slippery, and sodden; the sky lowering over those murky streets one uniform pall of inky gloom. A bad, desolate, blood-chilling November afternoon. And yet Mrs. Walraven's ball was to come off to-night, and it was rather hard upon Mrs. Walraven that the elements should make a dead set at her after this fashion. The ball was to be one of the most brilliant affairs of the season, and all Fifth Avenue was to be there in its glory.
