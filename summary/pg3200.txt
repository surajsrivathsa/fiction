As additional works of Mark Twain become available the present file will be updated to include them. The bibliography of Twain by Albert Bigelow Paine has been used in organizing the major works in this collection in the order of the date of their first publication; however many of the short stories, speeches and other shorter works are not in chronologic order as they were originally included as part of major works of much different publishing date.
