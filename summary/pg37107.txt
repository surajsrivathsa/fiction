A story written in the author's most striking vein, highly original and deeply interesting, and certainly not the least entertaining of her works. A thrilling story of Russian outrages on the Jews, of Nihilistic plotting and revenge. It admirably supplements the papers of George Kennan, which have filled so much of the public eye of late. This book is avowedly of the sensational kind, and of a different class of fiction from the author's previous story of "Paul Knox. Pitman;" the dramatic passages and vivid description of Indian life and scenery are exceptionally fine.
