THE LADY OR THE TALKER? Really and truly, all our hero wants is someone to listen to him

You see, it's quite simple. He had a wonderful time in Europe. He wants to tell folks back in the States all his adventures.

But our hero, in the nineteenth century, confronts a problem that has only gotten worse in the twenty-first.

What to do, oh what to do?

Well -- why not "hire someone to listen to him "

Why not that pretty young lady from that Protestant charitable order

Oh dear Can aught but misadventures and daffy romance be in the offing?
