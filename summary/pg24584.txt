When Jack's mother-in-law sends him and Stacey on a two-week cruise, they're determined to make the most of it, to forget about the cancer and its cold grip on their future.

Planning to revisit the earlier days of their marriage, and the unbridled romance that defined it, they'll lose themselves in paradise while building the resolve needed to endure the coming hell.

At least that was his plan...

Instead, he'll be cast into an ocean of deceit and dark conspiracy that will throw into doubt all that he holds dear in this world, putting to the test just how much love can truly believe...hope...and endure.
