I saw a woman sleeping. In her sleep she dreampt Life stood before her, and held in each hand a gift - in the one Love, in the other Freedom. And she said to the woman, "Choose!" And the woman waited long; and she said: "Freedom!" And Life said, "Thou hast well chosen. If thou hadst said, 'Love,' I would have given thee that thou didst ask for; and I would have gone from thee, and returned to thee no more. Now, the day will come when I shall return. In that day I shall bear both gifts in one hand." I heard the woman laugh in her sleep. Olive Schreener's Dreams.
