XXX p. 794 comments My little lady as follows: "There are certain female characters in novels which remind one of nothing so much as of a head of Greuze, - fresh, simple, yet of the cunningly simple type, 'innocent - arch,' and intensely naturalâ¦. 'My Little Lady' is a character of this Greuze-like kindâ¦. The whole book is charming; quietly told, quietly thought, without glare or flutter, and interesting in both character and story,â¦ and, if slight of kind, thoroughly good of its kind."
