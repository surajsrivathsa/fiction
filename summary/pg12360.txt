Ethel M. Dell "The years shall not outgo my thinking of thee" Â Â When you have reached the top of the world Â Â Â Â And only the stars remain, Â Â Where there is never the sound of storm Â Â Â Â And neither cold nor rain, Â Â Will it be by wealth, success, or fame Â Â Â Â That you mounted to your goal? Â Â Nay, I mount only by faith and love Â Â Â Â And God's goodness to my soul.
