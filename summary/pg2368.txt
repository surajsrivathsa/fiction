london: HURST AND BLACKETT, LIMITED 182, HIGH HOLBORN, W.C. 1908 I had a vexing dream one night, not long ago: it was about a fortnight after Christmas.Â I dreamt I flew out of the window in my nightshirt.Â I went up and up.Â I was glad that I was going up.Â "They have been noticing me," I thought to myself.Â "If anything, I have been a bit too good.Â A little less virtue and I might have lived longer.Â But one cannot have everything."Â The world grew smaller and smaller.Â The last I saw of London was the long line of electric lamps bordering the Embankment; later nothing remained but a faint luminosity buried beneath darkness.Â It was at this point of my journey that I heard behind me the slow, throbbing sound of wings. I turned my head.Â It was the Recording Angel.Â He had a weary look; I judged him to be tired.
