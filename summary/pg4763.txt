To my Child-friend. I charm in vain; for never again, All keenly as my glance I bend, Â Â Will Memory, goddess coy, Â Â Embody for my joy Departed days, nor let me gaze Â Â On thee, my fairy friend! Yet could thy face, in mystic grace, A moment smile on me, 'twould send Â Â Far-darting rays of light Â Â From Heaven athwart the night, By which to read in very deed Â Â Thy spirit, sweetest friend!
