Thomas Bailey Aldrich was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1836. Family circumstances forced a move when Aldrich was a child, but some years later he returned to prepare for college. "The Story of a Bad Boy" is the semi-autobiographical novel that reflects this period in his life. This book was written, (in 1870), while Aldrich was an editor for Ticknor and Fields, just before he became the editor of Atlantic Monthly. A more rueful, but elegant, tribute to his native Portsmouth capped his career in 1893 in "An Old Town By the Sea".
