A Splendid Chance for "SECRET SERVICE" Readers to get a good Time-piece. This Watch usually retails for $3.00, but owing to the immense quantity we have contracted for we procure them at such a low figure that we can afford to dispose of them to readers of our publications at the extremely low price of $1.00. It is an American watch that will keep accurate time, and will not get out of order. This we guarantee. The Case is strongly made and carefully fitted to exclude dust. It is Open Face with heavy polished bevel crystal. Case is heavily nickeled and presents a handsome appearance. Weight of watch complete 4Â½ oz. The Movement combines many patented devices, including American Lever, Lantern Pinion, Patent Escapement, and is a stem winder and stem setter, the same as any expensive watch. The cut, which falls far short of doing it justice, exactly represents the watch three-fourths size.
