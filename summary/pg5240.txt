"We talked of pipe-clay regulation caps - Â Â Â Long twenty-fours - short culverins and mortars - Condemn'd the 'Horse Guards' for a set of raps, Â Â Â And cursed our fate at being in such quarters. Some smoked, some sighed, and some were heard to snore; Â Â Â Some wished themselves five fathoms 'neat the Solway; And some did pray - who never prayed before - Â Â Â That they might get the 'route' for Cork or Galway." To Sir George Hamilton Seymour, G.C.H.
