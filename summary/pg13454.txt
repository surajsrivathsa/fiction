I see them and I hear As there they sit at morning, side by side. _With Barton elms behind - in front the sea, Â Â Sitting in rosy light in that alcove, They hear the first lark rise o'er Raxton Grove: 'What should I do with fame, dear heart?' says he, 'You talk of fame, poetic fame, to me Â Â Whose crown is not of laurel but of love - Â Â To me who would not give this little glove On this dear hand for Shakespeare's dower in fee.
