"If you will allow me, I shall have the pleasure of reading aloud to you some passages from 'Mrs. Lirriper's Lodgings,' by Charles Dickens. I do not know much about the book myself, as I have never read it. I dare say that you know more about it than I do; but I am given to understand" with a glance at the page before him "that Mrs. Lirriper was a lodging-house-keeper, that she kept lodgings in London. She was a very good sort of woman, I believe" another hasty glance , "but she sometimes had trouble with her servants. I am told that servants are troublesome sometimes" a slight nervous laugh, the more nervous because it does not seem to be followed by any echo from the audience . "If you will allow me then, as I say, and if you think it will amuse you, I will read you a little of what she says about these troubles." The foregoing remarks are uttered in a loud, shy, dogged voice by James Burgoyne to the "Oxford Women's Provident Association." His voice is loud because, being quite unused to public reading, he does not know how to modulate it; it is shy from the same cause of unaccustomedness; it is dogged because he is very much displeased with his present occupation, and has not been successful in concealing that displeasure. When a man runs down to Oxford for a couple of nights, to see how the six years that have passed since he turned his undergraduate back upon the old place have treated her - runs down to a college chum unseen for the same six years - this is certainly not the way in which he expects to spend one of his two evenings. "I hope you will not mind, Jim" - ominous phrase - the college friend has said; "but I am afraid we shall have to turn out for half an hour after dinner. It is rather a nuisance, particularly as it is such a wet night; but the fact is, I have promised to read to the 'Oxford Women's Provident Association.' Ah, by-the-bye, that is new since you were here - we had no Provident Women in your day!"
