One day, Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, became separated from his comrades who had accompanied him from the Land of Oz. Finding that time hung heavy on his hands -- and he had four of them! -- he decided to walk down the Main Street of the City and try to discover something-or-other of interest. So begins the adventures of the largest Woggle-Bug you have ever seen -- if you have ever seen even one -- in a thoroughly modern 1905 American city -- strutting down the street, his pink handkerchief in hand, his cane swirling . . . only to fall in love with the most stirringly enchanting beauty in a window!
