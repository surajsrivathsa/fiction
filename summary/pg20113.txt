The almost general desire to have The Owl and The Pussy-cat, The Duck and The Kangaroo, in a distinct form from Mr. Lear's other Nonsense Drolleries, has induced us to issue them separately with Original Illustrations. Fredk. Warne & Co. The Book of Nonsense. 27th Edition, 110 Illustrations printed in outline as originally published.
