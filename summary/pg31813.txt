I had never before attended the races. "The sport of kings" is not popular in Boston, my former home, but here in Chicago every one turns out on Derby Day, if at no other time. And so, catching something of the general enthusiasm, my friend Murray Jameson, who by the way is something of a sport, and I, who by the same token am not, found ourselves driving a very smart trap out Michigan avenue, amidst a throng of coaches, cabs, breaks and buggies, people and conveyances of every description - beautiful women beautifully costumed, young men, business men, toughs and wantons - all on their way to Washington Park, and all in a fever of excitement over the big race to be run that afternoon - the great American Derby. "Now Jack," said Murray, as in due process we reached our box and sat gazing at the crowds about and below us, "it strikes me that we should have a small bet of some sort on the different races, just to liven things up a bit. What say we go down into the betting ring and have a look at the odds?" "As you like," I answered, rising to show my willingness; "but you will have to do the necessary, I do n't know one horse from another."
