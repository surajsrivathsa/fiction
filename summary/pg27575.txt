Transcriber's Note: Amendments can be read by placing cursor over words with a dashed underscore like this. Domi mansit, lanam fecit: "He remained at home and wrote," is the first thing that should be said of Gustave Flaubert. This trait, which he shares with many of the writers of his generation, - Renan, Taine, Leconte de Lisle and Dumas fils, - distinguishes them and distinguishes him from those of the preceding generation, who voluntarily sought inspiration in disorder and agitation, - Balzac and George Sand, for instance to speak only of romance writers , and the elder Dumas or EugÃ¨ne Sue. Flaubert, indeed, had no "outward life;" he lived only for his art. A second trait of his character, and of his genius as a writer, is that of seeing in his art only the art itself - and art alone, without the mingling of any vision of fortune or success. A competency, - which he had inherited from the great surgeon, his father, - and moderate tastes, infinitely more bourgeois than his literature, - permitted him to shun the great stumbling-block of the professional man of letters, which, in our day, and doubtless in the United States as well as in France, is the temptation to coin money with the pen. Never was writer more disinterested than Flaubert; and the story is that Madame Bovary brought him 300 francs - in debts.
