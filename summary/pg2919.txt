Afternoon, on the departure platform of an Austrian railway station. At several little tables outside the buffet persons are taking refreshment, served by a pale young waiter. On a seat against the wall of the buffet a woman of lowly station is sitting beside two large bundles, on one of which she has placed her baby, swathed in a black shawl. WAITER. Yes, sare. WAITER. 'Komm' gleich'! AMERICAN. My eggs! Get a wiggle on you!
