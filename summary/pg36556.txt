The weird spelling in this book is mostly intentional, and it has been retained as in the original, this includes inconsistencies in spelling and hyphenation. A few changes to which seemed more likely typographic errors have been made, they are marked with a dotted underline, and the printed text may appear in a "pop-up box" when hovering the cursor on it. The changes are listed at the end of the book. Titles in the Table ov Kontents do not always correspond exactly to the titles in the main text, this has been retained, but the spelling has been changed in some cases to match the text. Some texts, near the end of the book are printed with no title in the original, this has been maintained too. The List of Illustrations contains some entries for non-existing in this edition, at least illustrations and the numbering is not consecutive, this reproduces the printed book as well. The original printed book was apparently divided into large "sections", which were marked only as running page headers. In this version the titles for these sections are written between {braces} where they start.
