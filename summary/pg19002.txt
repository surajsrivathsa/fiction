Excerpt from Alice's Adventures Under Ground: Being a Facsimile of the Original Ms. Book Afterwards Developed Into "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"

Let me add - for [feel 1 have drifted into far too serious a vein for a preface to a fairy tale - the deliciously naive remarh of a very dear ch ildy'riend, whom I ashed, after an acquaintance of two or three days, if she had read A lice and the Looking Glass.' Oh yes, she refilied readily, I've read both ey' them And I think (this more slowly and thoughtfully) I thinh Through the Loohing Glass is more stupid than A lice's A dventures.' Don't you thinh so But this was a question I felt it would be hardly discreet for me to enter upon.
