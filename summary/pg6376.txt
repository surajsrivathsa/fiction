Edition: 10 Noemi Millman, Juliet Sutherland, Charles Franks and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team. Â Â Something I know. Oft, shall it come about Â Â Â Â When every heart is full of hope for man, Â Â The horizon straight is darkened, and a doubt Â Â Â Â Clouds all. The work the youth so well began Â Â Wastes down, and by some deed of shame is finished. Â Â Â Â Ah, yet we will not be dismayed: Â Â What seemed the triumph of the Fiend at length Â Â Â Â Might be the effort of some dying devil, Â Â Permitted to put forth his fullest strength Â Â Â Â To loose it all forever! Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â - Owen Meredith.
