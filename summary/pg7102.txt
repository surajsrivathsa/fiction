IN this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: Â the Missouri negro dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect; the ordinary "Pike County" dialect; and four modified varieties of this last. The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech. I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding. Scene: Â The Mississippi Valley Time: Â Forty to fifty years ago "COME in," says the woman, and I did. Â She says: Â "Take a cheer."
