[Transcriber's note: William Tell Told Again is two children's books in one. One is a picture book--16 full-color illustrations by Philip Dadd described in verse by John W. Houghton. The other is a humorous novel by P. G. Wodehouse, based on the picture book. The novel has a lengthier storyline, a more intricate plot, and more characterization. The bound volume intermingled the picture book with the novel, illustrations and poems appearing at regular intervals. Most pictures and verses were distant from the page of the novel that they reflected. For this HTML version, thumbnail illustrations have been inserted following the paragraph in the novel that describes the events being illustrated. The verse descriptions of the illustrations have been moved to the end of the novel, so as not to disrupt the story. Each verse also has a thumbnail illustration.
