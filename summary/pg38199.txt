Scene: A Highland mountain, clad almost to the summit in purple heather. On the right a ravine, half hidden by drooping birch trees. On the left a pine forest. Sheep grazing in the foreground. Smoke upcurling from a humble cottage in the distance. A shepherd-boy talking to his dog; between them a lamb is lying on the ground. "It is dead, Kooran, dead, dead, dead. It is as dead as ever a lamb was, Kooran. Ay, my doggie, I ken you're sorrowful and anxious, but you may stand there and lick its little face and legs, till this time the morn, Kooran, but you can never bring back life to it again. "What do you say, Kooran? Its eyes are still bright and shinin' and life-like? True; but wait a wee, Kooran. Yes, wait a wee, dear frien'. In less than an hour, Kooran, its poor eyes will be glassy enough, and its bits o' legs as cold and stiff as the crook I'm holding in my hand.
