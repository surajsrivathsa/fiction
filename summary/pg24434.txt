Never's hot where Jim is - When the town is sweatin'; He jes' sets and answers, - "Well, I ain't a-frettin'!" Never's cold where Jim is - None of us misdoubt it, Seein' we're nigh frozen! He "ain't thought about it"! Things that rile up others Never seem to strike him! "Trouble-proof," I call it, - Wisht that I was like him! My pa - he always went to school, He says, an' studied hard. W'y, when he's just as big as me He knew things by the yard! Arithmetic? He knew it all From dividend to sum; But when he tells me how it was, My grandma, she says "Hum!" My pa - he always got the prize For never bein' late; An' when they studied joggerfy He knew 'bout every state. He says he knew the rivers, an' Knew all their outs an' ins; But when he tells me all o' that, My grandma, she just grins. My pa, he never missed a day A-goin' to the school, An' never played no hookey, nor Forgot the teacher's rule; An' every class he's ever in, The rest he always led. My grandma, when pa talks that way, Just laughs an' shakes her head. My grandma says 'at boys is boys, The same as pas is pas, An' when I ast her what she means She says it is "because." She says 'at little boys is best When they grows up to men, Because they know how good they was, An' tell their children, then!
