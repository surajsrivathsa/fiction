"Guten Morgen, Wilhelm!" said I, as I entered the chamber of my fellow student. "How are you this morning? You look better - your eyes are brighter, and your cheek possesses more colour than usual." "I am better, mein Freund," observed the youth, raising himself up from the bed till his back rested upon the pillows. "But what have you there?" "A fresh supply of flowers for you, Wilhelm," I replied; "and I bought them of the prettiest MÃ¤dchen I ever saw in the market place."
