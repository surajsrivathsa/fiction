IN this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: Â the Missouri negro dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect; the ordinary "Pike County" dialect; and four modified varieties of this last. The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech. I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding. Scene: Â The Mississippi Valley Time: Â Forty to fifty years ago WELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he went for me, too, for not stopping school. Â He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him or outrun him most of the time. Â I didn't want to go to school much before, but I reckoned I'd go now to spite pap. Â That law trial was a slow business - appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it; so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Â Every time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. Â He was just suited - this kind of thing was right in his line.
