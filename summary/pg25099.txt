Set up and electrotyped. Published December, 1909. Norwood Press J.Ã‚ S. Cushing Co. - Berwick & Smith Co. Norwood, Mass., U.S.A. In offering to the public this volume of Essays, all but two of which have been read at various places on different occasions, I am aware that there is some repetition in ideas and illustrations, but, as the dates of their delivery and previous publication are indicated, I am letting them stand substantially as they were written and delivered.
