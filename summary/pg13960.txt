I Dedicate This Book To G. T. S. In Remembrance of A Winter Day "When half-gods go, the gods arrive." Â Â R. W. Emerson Not with the clash of trumpets Â Â And clangour of gates thrown wide, As when the eager crowds press round Â Â Â To see the half-gods ride; But like a bird at even Â Â Â Silently winging home, A message came from the darkness Â Â Â To say that the gods had come.
