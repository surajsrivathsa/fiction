To the Kind People Who Read Our Books: I want to explain to you, in case it may interest you a little, why it is that I want to keep the "firm name" as we used to call it of "C. N. & A. M. Williamson," although my husband has gone out of this world. It is because I feel very strongly that he helps me with the work even more than he was able to do in this world. I always had his advice, and when we took motor tours he gave me his notes to use as well as my own. But now there is far more help than that. I cannot explain in words: I can only feel. And because of that feeling, I could not bear to have the "C. N." disappear from the title page.
