The first important event of my life transpired on the 22nd May, 1831. On that day I was born. Six weeks after, another event occurred which no doubt exerted an influence over my destiny: I was christened Rowland Stone. From what I have read of ancient history - principally as given by the Jews - I have reason to think, that I am descended from an old and illustrious family. No one can refute the evidence I have for believing that some of my ancestors were in existence many hundred years ago.
