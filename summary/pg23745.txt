Lattimore, supposed to be a town west of Chicago, is the name of a real place, which is boomed by speculators who are evidently real personages. Their schemes effect such a marvellous transformation in the heretofore dull town that the name Aladdin & Co. is given them. Although most of the novel is devoted to discussing the methods of modern land boomers, an old-fashioned love story makes the dryer details palatable.
