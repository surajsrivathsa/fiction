When you look at fine connections, it's hard to say exactly what relation "Alice in Wonderland" has to this book, "Through the Looking-Glass," Oh, it's plainly the same girl, though she seems older, here, and some characters (like Tweedledum and Tweedledee) appear in both. But she doesn't get there the same way, and doesn't refer to her adventures in Wonderland so much as once. Oh well: maybe it's all a dream and she can't remember the last one -- or maybe the magic through the Looking-Glass has hold of her, just as it has hold of Humpty Dumpty, or the Walrus and the Carpenter.
