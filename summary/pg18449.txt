Marie Corelli was born in England. She was the illegitimate daughter of the Scottish poet Charles Mackey and his servant. Marie was sent to a Parisian convent for her education. Published in 1906, this novel has been criticized for its melodramatic style and emotional writing. The book has a delightful note from the author at the beginning discussing her picture which her publisher insisted be placed in the front of the book. Her objections and criticisms of the picture are followed with a justification for the quality of the photo.
