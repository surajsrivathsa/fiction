IN this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: Â the Missouri negro dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect; the ordinary "Pike County" dialect; and four modified varieties of this last. The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech. I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding. Scene: Â The Mississippi Valley Time: Â Forty to fifty years ago WE dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down the river. Â We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty long ways from home. Â We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. Â It was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and dismal. Â So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they begun to work the villages again.
