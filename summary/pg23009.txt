"I call it real good of you, Mr. Letgood, to come and see me. Won't you be seated?" "Thank you. It's very warm to-day; and as I didn't feel like reading or writing, I thought I'd come round." "You're just too kind for anythin'! To come an' pay me a visit when you must be tired out with yesterday's preachin'. An' what a sermon you gave us in the mornin' - it was too sweet. I had to wink my eyes pretty hard, an' pull the tears down the back way, or I should have cried right out - and Mrs. Jones watchin' me all the time under that dreadful bonnet."
