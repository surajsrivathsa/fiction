Priscilla Glenn lives in Kenmore, a place which the Canadian Indians call "the in-place, the place beyond the winds". There are so many traditions, so many things to be proud of, yet Priscilla is different. She dreams of living in the big city. Would she be able to fulfil her dream? If she does, would she leave her traditions behind or remember when she came from? The novel includes descriptions of the traditions and sprawling nature, of the people of Kenmore, and of Priscilla herself. Many people go far away from home to fulfil some or other dream, but home is always there. The novel is perfect for everybody, including fans of Gene Stratton Porter.
