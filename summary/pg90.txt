The "Tarzan" stories, by the famous author, Edgar Rice Burroughs, have become history to the lovers of the motion picture art. The son of "Tarzan of the Apes," through inherited instinct and circumstances, is lured to the jungle. With his companion, Akut, a bull ape, he conquers the wild beasts, blacks and Arabs of the African wilderness and thereby gains the name of Korak, the Killer. The youth thrives on the life of the outdoors; the companionship of the ever-faithful anthropoid and a child of the Wilds, Meriem, to whom he is devoted, gives him four fold courage.
