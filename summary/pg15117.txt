"No fears hath she! Her giant form Majestically calm would go O'er wrathful surge, through blackening storm, 'Mid he deep darkness, white as snow! So stately her bearing, so proud her array, The main she will traverse forever and aye! Many ports shall exult in the gleam of her mast - Hush! hush! Thou vain dreamer, this hour is her last!" Each Book is in One Volume, Morocco Cloth, price $1.75. A DOUBLE WEDDING; or, How She Was Won. From Gail Hamilton, author of "Gala Days" etc.
