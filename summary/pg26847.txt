Prevailing beliefs and attitudes encourage researchers and lay people to think almost exclusively in terms of the costs of pessimism and the benefits of optimism. This volume provides a forum for those involved with the study of optimism and pessimism to have an opportunity to examine these beliefs. The result is a critical survey that enables readers to recognize the importance of "balance" in understanding the relative powers of both optimism and pessimism. With a focus on the practical implications for therapy, contributors provide up-to-date reviews of the empirical foundations of these constructs. Particularly valuable is an examination of cultural, biological, and psychological factors related to optimism and pessimism. Through the diversity of views presented, the dynamic interplay between optimism and pessimism that reflects the fundamental tension and harmony found in life is illustrated.
