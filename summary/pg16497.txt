Made in the United States of America Â Â Away in the sky, high over our heads, Â Â Â Â With the width of a world between, Â Â The far Moon sails like a shining ship Â Â Â Â Which the Dreamer's eyes have seen. Â Â And empty hands are outstretched, in vain, Â Â Â Â While aching eyes beseech, Â Â And hearts may break that cry for the Moon, Â Â Â Â The silver Moon out of reach!
