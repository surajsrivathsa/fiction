E-text prepared by Robin Eugene Escovado An Old-Fashioned Love Story It was a very ugly bush indeed; that is, so far as any thing in nature can be really ugly. It was lopsided - having on the one hand a stunted stump or two, while on the other a huge heavy branch swept down to the gravel-walk.

Besides, the owners of the garden, evidently of practical mind, had made use of it to place between a fork in its branches a sort of letter-box - not the government regulation one, for twenty years ago this had not been thought of; but a rough receptacle, where, the house being a good way off, letters might be deposited, instead of; as hitherto, in a hole in the trunk - near the foot of the tree, and under shelter of its mass of evergreen leaves.
