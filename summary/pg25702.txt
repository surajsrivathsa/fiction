Lord Taborley ('Tabs' to his friends) is a dreadfully dull and frankly rather stupid English lord returning home after World War I. I call him stupid because he just doesn't get it. He can't understand that Terry, the teenage girl he left behind five years ago, has outgrown him and her promise to marry him. From the very first chapter when Terry comes to the railroad station to pick Tabs up it's so obvious she's not that into him that she's practically beating him over the head with a FriendZone stick. Even after Terry tells him in no uncertain terms she's got the hots for someone else, Taborley seems to think it's just a phase she's going through and they'll still get married.
