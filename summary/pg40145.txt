We offer the Book as our Defense. Do not give way to vain regrets because you did not keep the good resolves you made a year ago. It might be worse. You might have kept the resolutions and have had no incentive for leading a better life this year. If there are as many Eclipses as during 1905-6, it will be a hard year on grafters and bosses. The editor is optimistic, however, believing that the sanitary revolution which swept the country has about blown over. Public confidence and laxity have been restored in a large measure and the time is now about ripe for us to get it in the neck again.
