My thanks are due to the Editors of Longman's Magazine, Temple Bar, the Argosy, Home Chimes, and the Illustrated London News, in which periodicals these stories first appeared. E. Nesbit. To be rich is a luxurious sensation - the more so when you have plumbed the depths of hard-up-ness as a Fleet Street hack, a picker-up of unconsidered pars, a reporter, an unappreciated journalist - all callings utterly inconsistent with one's family feeling and one's direct descent from the Dukes of Picardy.
