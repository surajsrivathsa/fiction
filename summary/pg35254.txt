"Well, by the Great Catamaran! I think it's the most footle business I ever heard of! A regulation, clinker-built, angle-iron, sunk-hinge family feud, carried on by two women! Women! conducting a feud! They might as well conduct a bakery!" "I daresay they could do even that! Women have been known to bake - with a fair degree of success!" "Of course, of course, - but baking and conducting a bakery are not identical propositions. Women are all right, in their place, - which, by the way, is not necessarily in the home, - but a family feud, of all things, calls for masculine management and skill."
