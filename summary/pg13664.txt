Transcriber's Note: Â Â The Gods of the Mountain Â Â The First Act of King Argimenes and the Unknown Warrior Â Â The Fall of Babbulkund Â Â The Sphinx at Gizeh Â Â Idle Days on the Yann Â Â A Miracle Â Â The Castle of Time Lady Wilde once told me that when she was a young girl she was stopped in some Dublin street by a great crowd and turned into a shop to escape from it. She stayed there some time and the crowd still passed. She asked the shopman what it was, and he said, 'the funeral of Thomas Davis, a poet.' She had never heard of Davis; but because she thought a country that so honoured a poet must be worth something, she became interested in Ireland and was soon a famous patriotic poet herself, being, as she once said to me half in mockery, an eagle in her youth.
