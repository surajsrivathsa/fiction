The Obstacle Race "So run, that ye may obtain." - I Corinthians 9:24 Â Â Give me the ready brain and steadfast face Â Â To dare the hazard and to run the race, Â Â The high heart that no scathing word can stay Â Â O'erleaping obstacles that bar the way, Â Â The sportsman's soul that, failing at the end, Â Â Can smile upon the victory of a friend, Â Â And to my judges make this one protest, - Â Â A poor performance but - I did my best!
