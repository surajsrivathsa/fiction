Tasper Britt arose in the gray dawn, as usual. Some fishermen, seeking bait, stay up late and "jack" angleworms with a bull's-eye light. The big worms are abroad on the soil under cover of the darkness. Other fishermen get up early and dig while the dew is holding the smaller worms near the surface of the ground; in going after worms the shrewd operator makes the job easy for himself. Tasper Britt - "Twelve-per-cent Britt" - trimmed his slumber at both ends - was owl and early bird, both, in his pursuit of the pence of the people, and got 'em coming and going.
