The following story of what has been known as "The Black Eagle Mystery" has been compiled from documents contributed by two persons thoroughly conversant with the subject. These are Molly Morgenthau Babbitts and John Reddy, whose position of inside observers and active participants makes it possible for them to give to the public a consecutive and detailed narrative of this most unusual case. "Hello!" said Babbitts from the sheets of the morning paper. I'll call him Babbitts to you because that's the name you'll remember him by - that is if you know about the Hesketh Mystery. I generally call him "Soapy," the name the reporters gave him, and "Himself," which comes natural to me, my mother being Irish. Maybe you'll remember that too? And he calls me "Morningdew" - cute, isn't it? It's American for my last name Morgenthau - I was Molly Morgenthau before I was married.
