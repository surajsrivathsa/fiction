The woman is named Margarita and claims to come from by the sea, her father having recently passed away and her sole companions a servant, Hester, and a dumb boy called Caliban.

Margarita marries the bachelor and starts to learn the ways of society, discovering an innate yet unconventional talent for music, which she cultivates to the point of public acclaim.
