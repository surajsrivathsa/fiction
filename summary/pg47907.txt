There is two kinds of prefisses one if it is by yourself and the other if you get a swell riter to do it for you. I'm going to do it by myself because I have done the talk undeneath the picktures so nice that I think people would be greviously diseppointed if Mr. Andrew Lang or someboddy was to do it instead like he did for Sybil Corbetts book thats the other little girl what started "Animal Land" . He did it awfull nice of course and then you can get such nice things into it about your grate tallent and your emaggynation if he does it. He is so lerned and drags in illusions to other grate authers but when you can auth as nice as what I can there isnt realy no need. If you do it yourself you must appolergise for it all they allways do and say it shall not accurr again. I am quite at the openning of my corea I saw that in the papers so I want ellowances made for my stile and imperfect penship - I want it all put down to yewth. I have done allmost all the most knowtable Animals - you cant do evryboddy when youve got musick and depportment to do too. I never thaught I would get to riting a Preffiss but it is abserdly easey.
