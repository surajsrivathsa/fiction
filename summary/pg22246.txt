The two stories by Mr. Crawford, presented in this volume, have been in print before, having been originally written for two Christmas annuals which were issued some years back. With the belief that the stories are, however, still unknown to the larger portion of Mr. Crawford's public, and in the opinion that they are well worthy of preservation in more permanent form, the publishers have decided to reprint them as the initial volume of the "Autonym" library. Small works by representative writers, whose contributions will bear their signatures. The Autonym Library is published in co-operation with Mr. T. Fisher Unwin, of London.
