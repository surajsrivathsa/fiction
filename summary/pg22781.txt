A gripping thriller of love, betrayal, and murder, in which the declining marriage of one couple pulls everyone around them into the dark

Warren Thompson—Bupps to his closest friends—wants nothing more than for his law partner and best friend, Jim Felderson, to win his sister’s hand in marriage. Helen can be capricious, at times even outright cold, but the wedding moves ahead anyway. All appears to be fine, until one day, Helen announces that she’s leaving Jim for another man. Frank Woods, whose easy demeanor, wealth, and charm inspire unease on the part of every married man in town, has his sights set on Helen. And it’s only a matter of time before he gets exactly what he wants. Not one to go down without a fight, Jim vows to dig up dirt on Frank, but as his suspicions as to the source of Frank’s income grow, a heated domestic dispute becomes something much more deadly. Caught in the middle of a mounting disaster, Bupps will soon find himself not only the arbiter of a nasty divorce but the lead investigator of a harrowing death as well!

The narrator, a lawyer and amateur detective, is pulled into the complicated lives of his best friend, his friend's wife, and her war-profiteer lover, during their ensuing divorce.
